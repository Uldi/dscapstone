## Needed Content

A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.

- Does the link lead to a 5 slide deck on R Pubs?
- Does the slide deck contain a description of the algorithm used to make the prediction?
- Does the slide deck describe the app, give instructions, and describe how it functions?
- How would you describe the experience of using this app?
- Does the app present a novel approach and/or is particularly well done?
- Would you hire this person for your own data science startup company?

## about the app, ...

## setup corpus, cleaning, model approaches
train model, test, verif split
sbo
no Laplace add-1 smoothing
with or without stopwors

tm, speedup mit quanteda
dplyr instead of for loops to generate MLE/P --> factor >1000

## model building final approach
algorithmus
kbo good touring, mit Formel
with stopwords

## testing, tuning, performance
with/without SW
filtering nextword when SW
filterning auf max(mle) per ngram
model as rds
reduced model: only 4 grams which have been seen more than once
